0.9.2 - Spitting up the google analytics code. <br/>
The plugin was based on google analytics javascript code that i was working on in collobration with SEO Specialist Mārtiņš Groza (https://lv.linkedin.com/in/martins-groza-a104a690) when we both were employees of Digitalscore (http://www.digitalscore.lv/) <br/>
So at starting point the common parts of that script, that can be used in any project, was split into several sections, that could be switched on or off.

0.9.1 - Setup, Initial version <br/>
Based upon one plugin template, that is a bit outdated, and almoust nothing have left of, but still want to give credit to the author of that plugin template
